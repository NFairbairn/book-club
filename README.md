# book-club

With the pandemic in full swing, I've had a lot of time to reflect on what it is I do with my time. I've discovered that I actually enjoy reading dispite my childhood hatred of reading anything on purpose. I never liked reading what teachers told me to read, but it turns out I enjoy learning far more than I anticipated.

This book club app is inspired by my friends and my desire to create a place where you could have discussions about books, and reccomend titles to people to encourage others to read more, to express their thoughts about books, and to create a community of readers who will engage eachother in hopefully somewhat intellectual conversations about the writing.

This project is an effort to create something that I would use, and that I would reccomend to my friends and coworkers so that we have a place to make reccomendations and discussions about the things we're reading.

The purpose for this project is to create something from thtr ground up. Since I graduated the Flatiron school Software Engineering Bootcamp, I got a job as a "tech support" role, and I don't do any coding during the day. I wanted to create this to prove I still had what it takes to be a developer, and to hopefully contribute to my portfolio so that I can go forward and become the developer, creator, and leader I want to be.

I encourage anyone who reads this to reach out to me for suggestions, tips and tricks, or if you want to collaborate I would love to learn more from the community and to work with other people to create something that we all could use.
